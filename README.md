# Udacity Android Nanodegree Sandwich Club Project

## Tasks

1. Design and build Detail Activity layout.
2. Populate all fields by parsing data from JSON and hiding those without content.
3. Publish on GitHub

## Issues

I was unable to get all the images to display. Not entirely sure why. I tried downloading and reducing the size and dimensions of the images in question. then reuploaded to imgur.com and replaced the links in the string.xml. That did not do the trick, unfortunately.
