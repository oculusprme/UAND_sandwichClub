# Udacity Android Nanodegree Sandwich Club Project

## Tasks

1. Design and build Detail Activity layout.
2. Populate all fields by parsing data from JSON and hiding those without content.
3. Publish on GitHub

## Issues

I did have a problem getting every one of the images to load, to the point where I reduced the size and dimensions of the originals then reuploaded to imgur, but after a restart they are now loading just fine in the emulator.
